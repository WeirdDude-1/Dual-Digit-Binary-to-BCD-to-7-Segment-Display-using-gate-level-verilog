# Dual-Digit-Binary-to-BCD-to-7-Segment-Display-using-gate-level-verilog
A system that takes binary input and displays the corresponding decimal  numbers on a 7-segment display for the numbers ranging from 0 to 99. The project will be implemented using  Verilog gate-level modelling. The system consists of two major modules: a binary to BCD converter BCD to  7-segment display drivers.
