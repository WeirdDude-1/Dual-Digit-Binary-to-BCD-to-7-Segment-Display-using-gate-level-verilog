# Dual-Digit-Binary-to-BCD-to-7-Segment-Display-using-gate-level-verilog
A system that takes binary input and displays the corresponding decimal  numbers on a 7-segment display for the numbers ranging from 0 to 99. The project will be implemented using  Verilog gate-level modelling. The system consists of two major modules: a binary to BCD converter BCD to  7-segment display drivers.
## Modules 
Binary to BCD Converter: The Binary to Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) Converter module serves as the 
core component responsible for converting an 8-bit binary input into its BCD equivalent. This process is 
executed utilizing the revered Shift and Add-3 Algorithm, a methodology widely employed in digital circuitry 
for BCD conversion. 

## Significance and Implications

This project holds paramount significance in the realm of digital systems design and embedded applications. 
By effectively converting binary inputs to their decimal representations and interfacing with a 7-segment 
display, this system enables real-world applications such as digital clocks, counters, and instrumentation 
displays. Moreover, the utilization of gate-level modeling in Verilog fosters a deeper understanding of digital 
circuitry and paves the way for further exploration into advanced digital design concepts. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the integration of Binary to BCD conversion and subsequent display on a 7-segment display 
underscores a pivotal aspect of digital systems design. Through meticulous implementation and adherence to 
the Shift and Add-3 Algorithm, this project promises to deliver a robust and efficient solution capable of 
accurate decimal representation visualization.
